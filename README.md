[MedMNIST_code(ResNet)](https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST)

### Some findings:

1.For MNIST dataset,ResNet's training accuracy and validation accuracy(99.86,99.45) are both a little higher than LeNet's(99.68,98.58) after 15 epoch!

2.For MedMNIST dataset(choose 'organmnist_axial'),ResNet's training accuracy(99.61) is a little lower than LeNet's(99.75),while ResNet's validation accuracy(98.12) is much higher than LeNet's(93.45) after 15 epoch!And LeNet's validation loss is very high!We can conclude that the ResNet is better than LeNet!
